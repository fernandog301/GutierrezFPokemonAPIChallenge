peer reviwed desc: Both pokemon img and favorite button are not centered. They're also small compared to the other components on the page. Star button is hard to find.  Doesn't display the pokemon's evolution path. Responsive for table  and desktop mode but not for modbile. The search, favorites, and random function works. The favorite's button image doesn't update based on the local storage status. Most of the requirements were fuffilled.
